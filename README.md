Detecting credit card fraud transactions using PySpark and Random Forest Algorithm. The dataset being used is from credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013.

Developed a tool to predict fraud credit card transactions using PySpark and Machine Learning. The system helps detect fraudulent transactions made by credit card thieves and protect people's finances.

The dataset used contained information on credit card transactions made by European cardholders in September 2013. Out of the total number of transactions, only a very small percentage of them (0.172%) were fraudulent: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud?resource=download

To train the model, the process is to first clean and process the data. Then, used Random Forest Algorithm to predict whether a transaction was fraudulent or not. The model achieved a high level of accuracy, with an AUC score of 96.3%.

This system could be implemented in various industries and businesses that deal with credit card transactions, such as banks, financial institutions, credit card companies, and e-commerce websites. It could be used to detect and prevent fraud in real-time, helping to protect customers' financial data and prevent financial losses.
